2. Click "New +" → "Static Site"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Render will auto-detect `render.yaml`
5. **IMPORTANT**: Add these environment variables:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://0ec90b57d6e95fcbda19832f.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your_anon_key>
   ```
6. Click "Create Static Site"
7. Wait for initial build to complete (3-5 minutes)

### Step 4: Configure Custom Domain

1. In Render dashboard, go to your site settings
2. Navigate to "Custom Domains"
3. Click "Add Custom Domain"
4. Enter: `hagglehub.app`
5. Render will show you the CNAME target (e.g., `hagglehub-app.onrender.com`)

### Step 5: Update DNS in GoDaddy

1. Log in to GoDaddy: https://dcc.godaddy.com/
2. Go to "My Products" → "DNS"
3. Find `hagglehub.app` and click "DNS"
4. Add/Update these records:

   **For root domain (@):**
   - Type: A or ALIAS (if supported) OR
   - Type: CNAME
   - Host: @
   - Points to: `your-site.onrender.com` (from Render dashboard)
   - TTL: 1 Hour

   **For www subdomain (optional):**
   - Type: CNAME
   - Host: www
   - Points to: `your-site.onrender.com`
   - TTL: 1 Hour

5. Save changes

4. Update these settings:
   - **Site URL**: `https://hagglehub.app`
   - **Redirect URLs**: Add `https://hagglehub.app/**`
5. Keep the localhost URL for development: `http://localhost:5173/**`
6. Save changes

### Step 7: Verify Deployment

- [ ] Visit https://hagglehub.app
- [ ] Verify HTTPS is working (green lock icon)
- [ ] Test login/authentication flow
- [ ] Create a test deal
- [ ] Check dashboard loads correctly
- [ ] Verify all navigation links work

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### First 24 Hours
- [ ] Monitor Render dashboard for any errors
- [ ] Check Supabase logs for unusual activity
- [ ] Review Mailgun delivery reports
- [ ] Test from different devices and browsers
- [ ] Monitor user feedback (if any)

### First Week
- [ ] Review performance metrics in Render
- [ ] Check database query performance in Supabase
- [ ] Monitor email delivery rates in Mailgun
- [ ] Verify SSL certificate is valid and renewing

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Site Won't Load
1. Check DNS propagation: https://dnschecker.org
2. Verify Render build completed successfully
3. Check environment variables are set correctly
4. Review Render logs for build errors

### Authentication Not Working
1. Verify Supabase Site URL matches production domain
2. Check redirect URLs include production domain
3. Ensure VITE_SUPABASE_URL and KEY are correct
4. Clear browser cache and cookies

### Routes Return 404
1. Verify `_redirects` file is in dist folder
2. Check render.yaml has correct rewrite rules
3. Ensure SPA routing is configured in Render

### Email Not Sending
1. Verify Mailgun DNS records are active
2. Check Mailgun API key in Supabase Edge Functions
3. Review send-email function logs in Supabase
4. Confirm Mailgun domain is verified

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues occur:

1. In Render dashboard, go to "Deploys" tab
2. Find the last working deployment
3. Click "Redeploy" on that commit
4. Notify users of temporary downtime if needed
5. Fix issues in development
6. Test thoroughly
7. Re-deploy when ready
